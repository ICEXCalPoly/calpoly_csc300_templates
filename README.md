# How to Use this Repository

The easiest way to use this repository is to clone it using Git.  Git is
available on every major platform.  These instructions work on Vogon, and
should work on any system with git installed.

 <git clone git://github.com/mgius/calpoly_csc300_templates.git>

This should provide you with an exact copy of the repository.  You can choose
to use Git at this point, or you can copy the files elsewhere and use them.

## But I don't have / want Git

You can download the raw files by navigating the web folders you see here.  You
can copy/paste the contents of the file, or download the file directly by
selecting "raw". I highly reccomend using git, however.
