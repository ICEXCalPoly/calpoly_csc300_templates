# How to Use this Repository

The easiest way to use this repository is to clone it using Git.  Git is
available on every major platform.  These instructions work on Vogon, and
should work on any system with git installed.

 <git clone git://github.com/mgius/calpoly_csc300_templates.git>

This should provide you with an exact copy of the repository.  You can choose
to use Git at this point, or you can copy the files elsewhere and use them.

## But I don't have / want Git

You can download the raw files by navigating the web folders you see here.  You
can copy/paste the contents of the file, or download the file directly by
selecting "raw". I highly reccomend using git, however.

# I would like to contribute an example

I would love more examples.  Fork this repository (preferably by signing up for
github and forking it that way), add your examples and send me a pull request.
If you are opposed to that idea, I'll take git patches as well.  Pleas test
your example on vogon before submitting it, or note that it requires a newer
version than vogon if it cannot compile on vogon.

Before submitting your examples, please take a moment to add a header comment
(like the ones I've added) and any other notes that you think would be helpful.
