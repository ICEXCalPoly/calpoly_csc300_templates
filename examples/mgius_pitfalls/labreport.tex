% Quoting in LaTeX is sometimes a little funny. 
% See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Formatting#Quotes for more info

You cannot use \verb+"+ to achieve double quotes, you must use the left tick
and the right tick instead.  

\verb+This is a ``double quoted'' entry+

is converted to 

This is a ``double quoted'' entry.

\verb+This is a `single quoted' entry+

is converted to

This is a `single quoted' entry

This behavior is difficult to see in a compiled tex document, check out the 
source.
